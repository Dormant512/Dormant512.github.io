# Dormant512 blog

Welcome to the *github page* that hosts my personal blog. Few things to say there:

1. This website is hosted from a public repository on purpose. You can copy materials and templates. However, if you are willing to use information posted here for your own article, please, credit my blog as the source. I will be grateful to be of any help!
2. My blog is devoted to some *major events in my life* as a chemistry bachelor who is delving into development and tech stuff in general. Although, many posts will be related to my *advances in programming* and *setting up an ideal automated linux environment* for development. The rest will be touching the topics of my *hobbies* such as coding pet projects, D&D, Chinese teas and music production.
3. If you encounter any bugs on the blog, please, contact me via email (specified in my github account), vk or reddit. Any feedback regarding design issues or poor readability on certain devices will be highly appreciated!
4. The blog will be written in three languages: english, russian and german. As translation takes time, translations of the newly written article will not appear simultaneously to the original text. Again, any feedback on grammatical mistakes will be appreciated!
5. The website is powered by *Jekyll*, styled by vanilla CSS and made slightly interactive by vanilla JS. This may change in the future.
