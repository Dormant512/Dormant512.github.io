<h1>About me</h1>

Hi, my name is Mikhail Grigoryev (Michael, if you prefer). Dormant is my nickname in social media and 512 happens to be my favourite number. Hence my github username and the name of the blog webpage.

<h2>Who am I?</h2>

I am a chemistry bachelor and am willing to become a web developer instead. Currently I am studying for a degree in web dev and for internships in the same sphere.

<h2>Any other interests?</h2>

Well, yes. I draw both traditionally and digitally, play the guitar and bass, record random audio fx, develop, play and DM homebrew D&D, enjoy the whole spectrum of chinese teas in gong fu style of brewing and give life to a number of personal projects be it art, audio, D&D or something tech-related.

<h2>Pet projects?</h2>

Yes, some of them are...

<div class="pet-projects">
  <div class="project">
    <h3>Faceless / endless dream [name may change]</h3>
  
    I have been writing down every single dream I've had since 2017. Some of the dreams will probably even make it to blog posts. My plan is to world-build a setting in a dream world where some of my dreams take place and make an exploration game out of it. Some location maps, audio fx and soundtracks are already written for the game. It is obviously an early stage project though.
  </div>

  <div class="project">
    <h3>Masters of Cognitei</h3>
    
    Me and one of my best friends are currently world-building Cognitei - a unique post-apocalyptic arcane-punk D&D setting with elaborated lore. We are also developing a set of rules based on D&D that are optimised for gameplay in Masters of Cognitei.
    
    I am making an online web service to make managing character sheets among players and DMs easier. It is a work in progress as I am learning Node.js.
  </div>

  <div class="project">
    <h3>Banka Cherneel (Jar of Ink)</h3>
    
    I regularly post drawings of mine to a VK group called Banka Cherneel. If you would like to take a look, here you <a href="https://vk.com/bunquhchaerneel">go</a>.
  </div>

  <div class="project">
    <h3>Quartersketch</h3>
    
    Once upon a time I wanted to one-up my drawing skills by drawing quick sketches daily. Me and a couple of my friends set a tradition of gathering in discord and drawing 15-minute sketches on topics that we made up on the go. I called it Quartersketches (quarter of an hour per sketch). The golden rules of quartersketches are:
    <ol>
      <li>Not shaming anybody's drawing skills and not shaming anyone in general.</li>
      <li>One participant names a broad topic. For example, "medieval buildings with a modern twist".</li>
      <li>Participants request each other specific sketches. For example, a requested sketch on the topic above could be "a round watchtower with an external elevator". </li>
      <li>All participants draw requested sketches in just 15 minutes. By the way, I am planning to write a timer discord bot optimised for quartersketches.</li>
      <li>Repeat.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  
  <div class="project">
    <h3>My future music releases</h3>
    
    I have material written but nothing has been published yet as I suffer from perfectionist-songwriter complex. Genres are post-punk, post-rock, indie rock and heavy metal (a lot of subgenres). I record guitar parts and bass lines for the tracks and program drums and synths, although in the future I want to learn real drums.

<h2>Conclusions?</h2>

Well, here you are. Explore the blog at will and find out more about me. Everyone who loves and respects other humans is welcome on this website.
